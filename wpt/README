In order to run the script you need to edit it and ensure you have filled ouot the following:

1.  Chosen the correct location - the default is Dulles using IE9 and DSL for the connection speed.
2.  Ensure you've supplied an API Key for talking to WPT
3.  If you are not using the Public WPT, then you'll need to change the API URL's.
4.  Make sure you update the working directories to your install location.  This includes the location where the HAR file will be downloaded.
	HAR_DIR
	WORKING_DIR

It is recommended that you install the HAR Viewer so that once you've generated a HAR file from WPT, you can then view it on your local.  For more information on the offline  HAR Viewer go to: http://code.google.com/p/harviewer/
